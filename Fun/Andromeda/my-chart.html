                        It's in your 12th house meaning you feel the need to distinguish yourself from others through privacy, secrets, and introspection. You have a tendency to be introspective and need some space and seclusion in order to pull up your strength. You may avoid the spotlight, and if you do find yourself in a public role, you tend to hide your true self behind that role! Because your will is directed inwards, you need to find a path for yourself that allows you to "get away from it all" at least some of the time. Honor your need to be alone with yourself, but avoid over-identifying with your inner world to the point that you truly feel alone in a crowd.

                <h2>~ Moon Sign ~</h2>
                <p>The Moon represents the emotional responses, unconscious pre-destination, and the self-image. The Moon represents the emotions, and the Moon sign shows how a person expresses themselves when at home, at ease, and comfortable.</p>
                <h3>Moon in Libra</h3>
                <div class="moon-sign-body">
                    <p>You have a deep need for peace and harmony. A negotiator, you can easily see both sides of every argument, find the middle ground, and deal with the situation and the people in it respectfully. You have an eye for design, and appreciate all forms of symmetry and composition. Your home has a tranquil energy with a neat appearance that infuses a sense ofserenity into their life since you thrive in calm enviornments. You thrive when you have an abundance of friendship and love in your life. This doesn't necessarily mean you are a party animal.

Your love of people makes you an extremely caring and sympathetic friend who can be counted on to lend a listening ear when needed. Additionally, you are very fair, always giving an objective perpective.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You simply can't help but see flaws in your environment and your relationships. In fact, anything out of whack will bother you until it's fixed. Although diplomatic with acquaintances, when you argue with your long-standing partners, you rarely let up until you win. And, winning an argument is a Libran specialty--in fact, you may not even believe what you are saying, but will adopt all kinds of ideas just to get the last word. Your moon is in the 11th house, indicating your emotional need for a feeling of belonging with, and support from, friends and associations with groups. However, Feelings of friendship can sometimes feel superficial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because your  Moon is in hard aspect to Saturn in the natal chart, you need to learn to trust others more. Fear keeps you from fully enjoying personal relationships, and fear is behind the occasional rigidity that you express. When you let themselves receive nurture or care from others, an inner voice cautions you that it might not be sincere, long-lasting, or enough. You have changeable moods, a reserved character, can be stubborn, and may lack assurance

Your insights and opinions are usually interesting and exciting, although sometimes lacking in details.

Faith, belief and the ability to foresee and envision the future or “what could be” are essential elements of your soul function. You may well be ahead of your time or at the fore front of coming trends and movements in the collective. You are a seeker, one who searches for the overview, the larger pattern, or a broad, over-arching philosophy of life – and also a teacher who conveys that vision or broadcasts it in some way.

                    <p>
                        You give your lover your complete attention and focus, with a strong need to control them, although this will not be immediately apparent and you'll likely never admit it. Your body-and-soul love and commitment can be so intense that it eclipses fun and makes loving you a very heavy experience. You take things to extremes, and can be very provocative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although you want to explore all of your partner's nooks and crannies, you won't always be forthcoing with your own.

Regardless, a slighted Scorpio in Venus is not a pretty sight. You can be jealous of all their attachments, but won't admit it. You are not afraid of being underhanded in matters of the heart, and you are an expert at cutting through all the fluff in order to see your partner for who they really are.
