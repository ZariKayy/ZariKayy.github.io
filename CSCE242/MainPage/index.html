                <a href="../Assignments/Assignment1/index.html" id="img"><img src="Images/A1.png" alt="Assignment 1 screenshot" width="300" height="150"></a>
                <p>Assignment 1 covered the basics of HTML. I love to study Astrology, so for this project I chose that as my theme. I created a header and body complete with unordered lists that were also links to the other pages of the site. Within the other pages there are tables, ordered lists, paragraphs, headings, and more images. After completing this project I knew without a doubt that I would enjoy learning HTML.</p>

                <p>Assignment 2 covered the basics of CSS. For this assignment I had the chance to decorate my page with colors and images, as well as create a nav bar. This project's theme was Pirates of the Caribbean, one of my favorite movie series. Within the several pages of the site, there are lists, images, paragraphs, headings, and links formated with CSS.</p>

                <p>Assignment 3 covered page layout with the use of flex. I enjoyed this assignment because I had finally learned the skills to organize my page more efficiently. I was also able to use media queries to customize the appearance and layout for bothe large and small screens. Within this project there were images, columns, paragraphs, headings, and a nav bar.</p>

                <p>This assignment did not really have a number since it just re-designed my home page, but I decided to label it as Assignment 4 since the next one was the 5th assignment and properly named as such. For this assignment I had the chance to use everthing I have learned so far to re-create my Home Page to make it look more appealing.</p>

                <p>Assignment 5 covered JavaScript and getting data from the HTML page. A centered box was created with a few input fields and a button. The page basically gives you a sentance describing who you are, what you bought, how many, and the price after tax.</p>
