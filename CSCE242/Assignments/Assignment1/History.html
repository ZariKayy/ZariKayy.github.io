        <h1>The History of Astrology</h1>
        <p>Astrology has been around as long as there has been stars in the sky. The study of the stars can be dated back to the 2nd millennum BCE. The Vedanga Jyotisa from the first dynasty of Mesopotamia from 1950 to 1651BCE is one of the earliest texts on Astrology. Today much of the population look to the stars to help determine their important life decisions or to simply help decipher their own personality.</p>
